# odin-etch-a-sketch2
This project is created as an assignment from The Odin Project. The user can fill the grid 
similarily to how an etch-a-sketch works.

Customization and functionality includes:
    - Changing the color drawn
    - Changing the size of the grid
    - Toggling a "rainbow" color on and off
    - Toggling grid lines on and off
    - Using an eraser
    - Clearing the grid

Skills I have learned and incorporated into this project include:
    - Manipulating the DOM
    - Adding events and event handlers to DOM objects
    - CSS flex and grid
